### Static geographic dataset
accessible on the WRF Users' page (https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html)
under the name of "Highest Resolution of each Mandatory Field". Due to their large dimensions, we preferred to provide here only the link.

### Fuel and high resolution maps 
provided by Landfire website (https://www.landfire.gov/) and properly cut for our domain simulation, are accessible on the Google Drive, in the folders NFUEL_CAT and ZSF
(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_bPQD0bYPEROuYgX6LdGz3natJRzvOhL).

### Meteorological global datasets from GFS model
are provided by the Research Data Archive
 in the UCAR website (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/). We downloaded meteorological dataset 
referring from 05 june 2020 at 00:00 AM, to 13 june 2020 at 12:00 PM. These datasets are accessible on the Google Drive, in the folder GFS 
(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14jtfsnYTBgeepaq6Klc1iGIPgpNN6Qha).

### Datasets for ideal simulations 
provided in the WRF folders. We adopted the _Input_sounding file_ of the Hill simulation and the _Input_sounding file_ of the Two Fire simulation. These datasets
are accessible on the Google Drive, in the folder IDEAL_ONE_FIRE(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NklM2WiqG7dlIOtzz8mlZfSd7aLEf3cm).
