### Static geographic dataset
accessible on the WRF Users' page (https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html)
under the name of "Highest Resolution of each Mandatory Field". Due to their large dimensions, we preferred to provide here only the link.

### Fuel and high resolution maps 
provided by Landfire website (https://www.landfire.gov/) and properly cut for our domain simulation, are accessible in the folders [NFUEL_CAT](/WRF/GIS_&_Datasets/NFUEL_CAT/) and [ZSF](/WRF/GIS_&_Datasets/ZSF/). 

### Meteorological global datasets from GFS model
are provided by the Research Data Archive in the UCAR website (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/). We downloaded meteorological dataset 
referring from 05 june 2020 at 00:00 AM, to 13 june 2020 at 12:00 PM. These datasets are accessible in the folder [GFS](/WRF/GIS_&_Datasets/GFS/). 

### Datasets for ideal simulations 
provided in the WRF folders. We adopted the _Input_sounding file_ of the Hill simulation and the _Input_sounding file_ of the Two Fire simulation. These datasets
are accessible in the folder [IDEAL_ONE_FIRE](/WRF/GIS_&_Datasets/IDEAL_ONE_FIRE/).
