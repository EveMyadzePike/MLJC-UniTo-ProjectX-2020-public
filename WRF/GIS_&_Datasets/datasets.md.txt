DATASETS:
- Static geographic dataset accessible on the WRF Users' page
(https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html)
under the name of "Highest Resolution of each Mandatory Field".
Because of their large dimensions we preferred to provide here only the link.

- Fuel and high resolution maps, provided by Landfire website (https://www.landfire.gov/) and properly
cut for our domain simulation, are accessible on the Google Drive, in the folders NFUEL_CAT and ZSF
(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_bPQD0bYPEROuYgX6LdGz3natJRzvOhL)

- Meteorological global datasets from GFS model, are provided by the Research Data Archive
 in the UCAR website (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/). We downloaded meteorological dataset 
referring from 05 june 2020 at 12:00 PM, to 06 june 2020 at 12:00 PM.
These datasets are accessible on the Google Drive, in the folder GFS 
(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14jtfsnYTBgeepaq6Klc1iGIPgpNN6Qha)

- Datasets for ideal simulations just provided in the WRF folders. We adopted the Input_sounding
file of the Hill simulation and the Input_sounding file of the Two Fire simulation. These datasets
are accessible on the Google Drive, in the folder IDEAL_ONE_FIRE
