  Julia Environments
</h1>

In order to develop our project, we needed to work with specific versions of Julia's packages compatible with our aims. For these reasons, we present here the Julia environments set to run our implementations: 
* [Euler System's environment](/Julia_Environments/hdimsys_env/); 
* [First Level Set's environment](/Julia_Environments/level_set_env/), adopted in the first stages of level set's implementations;
* [Final Level Set's environment](/Julia_Environments/level_set_quadrature_training_env/), involving [Quadrature](https://github.com/SciML/Quadrature.jl) training, used in the final version of our level set's implementation.
