This is a description of the various example of the level set equation simulations made to illustrate the current capabilities of our model.
Unless otherwise stated, all simulations have this hyperparameters:
n = 16
maxIters = 1500
Scale factors = 1
extrapolate = true, timeFactor = 2.5, spatialFactor = 1.25
Lx = 10000   #Domain x width in meters
Ly = 10000   #Domain y width in meters
Lt = 3600    #Total simulation time in seconds

xRes = 30    #Resolution of x axis in meters, mesh cell width
yRes = 30    #Resolution of y axis in meters, mesh cell width
tRes = 60    #Time resultion, seconds



1. Corner_with_wind_1: the fire is set with a circular ignition start. Wind is set costant in south-ovest direction. The somewhat triangular shape
expected in this situation is displaied by our model.

2. Corner_with_wind_2: same as Corner_with_wind_1, but wind blows in north-east direction.
